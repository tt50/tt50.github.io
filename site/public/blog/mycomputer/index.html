  <p>random stuff about my computer</p>
<p>Previously my desktop computer had windows 10 installed for a while, I mainly used it only for watching media and playing video games. Then I updated to windows 11 in order to get system/security updates, but I only used it for a month. The ui was extremely bloated, with random news/copliot/weather icons on the lock screen, desktop screen, menu, taskbar, basically everywhere. Additionally, for windows in general I found the windows filesystem/commandprompt/powershell confusing to use, and files that should be saved to documents would save to onedrive for some reason.</p>
<p>So I decided recently during this month (November 2025) to switch using Linux Mint. I figured out how to do some basic customiztion with the default and downloadable applets, extensions and themes. I added the OrchideaDock theme from the download section. Then I added on my taskbar workplace switcher and windows quick list, which are really convient for managing different windows and seeing what I have opened. For extensions I downloaded negate window super+i which lets me invert any window I recently clicked on, and gTile where I can tile my windows without struggle.</p>
<p>Desktop

<p>Downloading files on linux mint wasn&rsquo;t too difficult as long as the software I wanted had clear documentation, and worked for debian or ubuntu. The software manager is super easy to download from and there is a lot of popular applications avaiable like steam, vlc player, discord. I tried out new of apps I never used before like rss guard which lets me save a feed of things I want to follow without having to manually checking different websites or channels, and supertuxkart which is like less bloated mario kart.</p>
<p>I was able to run btd6, cs2, tf2, and minecraft java edition on my system natively or with steam proton. Protondb.com shows reports on what games work or doesn&rsquo;t work on linux proton. Im not going try what other games will work on my system, Im going to use this as a opportunity to waste less time playing games and buying new ones, as I would only play those few occasionality.</p>
