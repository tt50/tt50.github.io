  <p>random stuff about my computer and linux noob experience</p>
<p>Previously, my desktop computer had Windows 10 installed for a while. I mainly used it only for watching media and playing video games. Then I updated to Windows 11 in order to get system/security updates, but I only used it for a month. The ui was extremely bloated, with random news/copliot/weather icons on the lock screen, desktop screen, menu, taskbar, basically everywhere. For Windows in general I found the Windows filesystem/commandprompt/powershell confusing to use, and files that should be saved to documents would save to onedrive for some reason.</p>
<p>So I decided recently during this month (November 2025) to switch to using Linux Mint. I figured out how to do some basic customization with the default and downloadable applets, extensions and themes. I added the OrchideaDock theme from the download section. On my taskbar I added switcher and windows quick list, which are convenient for managing different windows and seeing what I have opened. For extensions, I downloaded Negate Window Super+I which lets me invert any window I recently clicked on, and gTile where I can tile my windows without struggle.</p>
<p>Desktop

<p>Downloading files on Linux Mint wasn&rsquo;t too difficult as long as the software I wanted had clear documentation, and worked for Debian or Ubuntu. The software manager is super easy to download from and there is a lot of popular applications avaiable, like Steam and VLC Player. I tried out new apps I have never used before, like RSS Guard which lets me save a feed of things I want to follow without having to manually check different websites or channels, and SuperTuxKart which is like a less bloated Mario Kart.</p>
<p>I was able to run Bloons Tower Defense 6, Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Minecraft Java Edition on my system natively or with steam proton. Protondb.com shows reports on what games work or doesn&rsquo;t work on Proton. I&rsquo;m not going to try to test what other games will work on my system though. I&rsquo;m going to use this as a opportunity to stop buying new ones on steam or any game market.</p>
