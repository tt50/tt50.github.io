Philly needs a Roosevelt Boulevard Subway Line

This webpage visualization is on why Philadelphia needs a Roosevelt Boulevard subway line. I wanted to address "What demographics could benefit from this subway line as a means of transportation? Especially in the northeast area." Philadelphia is a density populated city, while most people in the northeast area use their personal vehicles, there is still a large amount of people in the area who depend on public transportation, or do not own a vehicle in their household. I visualizate using a zip code boundary map and tooltip mouseover hovering the percentages of these demographics per zip code in the area. Additionally, the larger percentages of people using their own vehicles to commute to work, this could be due to the lack of reliable transportation options in the area. The second visualiaztion is of the proposed subway line route using leaflet.js and leaflet layering.

Lessons learned:
It may take some time to find appropriate and relateable datasets that work with your project.
Plan out how the visualizations will look ahead of time, to help figure out the scope of the visualizations you want to implement.
Having interaction with your project makes it more engaging to the user.
